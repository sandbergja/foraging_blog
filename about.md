In 2023, I'm going to be spending a lot of time outside: foraging, gardening, and the like.
These activities are important to me for two reasons:

* Getting outside really makes me feel better, both physically and mentally.
* Working with delicious and unusual ingredients makes cooking more creative and fun!

I hope you enjoy these blog posts!
