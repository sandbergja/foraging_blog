This week was a stressful one, including some unexpected travel to Eastern Washington.
Foraging was a high point of the week: my family and I gathered green pine cones for
mugolio and enjoyed several mugs of fir tip tea.  Ripe saskatoon berries were all over,
and there were enough elderberry blossoms for me to make elderflower cordial for the
first time.  And I'm particularly proud of a culinary experiment: I used oxeye daisies
in place of pecans in a pecan pie recipe, and it turned out so nice!
