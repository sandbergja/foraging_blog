Today, I harvested my valerian plant for the first time.  The cats were very interested in smelling my fingers after I was done cleaning the roots!  I'm planning to dry the roots, then use them in teas.  While the valerian plant was out of its pot, I took the opportunity to refresh its soil.

Since my last blog post, I also harvested my shiitake and oyster mushroom blocks, and picked some hairy cats ear.  I've got the hairy cats ear's roots infusing in some vodka for use as bitters in cocktails.
