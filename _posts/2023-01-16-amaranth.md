Yesterday, I started work on separating some amaranth seeds from their stalks.  I had taken down the stalks in November and dried them, but hadn't gotten around to separating the seeds yet.  I saved some seeds to plant next year, and am intrigued by some recipes for popped amaranth, so I'll use the rest for that.

I also picked some rosemary from the garden.  I'm planning to make that into a rosemary salt.
