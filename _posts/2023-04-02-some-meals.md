It's been a while since my last post.  Here are a few things I've enjoyed harvesting and eating lately:

* Instant ramen with both stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) and purple deadnettle (Lamium purpureum).
* Turnips and turnip greens from the garden.
* Chickweed that started growing in one of the pots in our garden -- just a nice snack!
