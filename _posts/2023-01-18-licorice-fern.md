Today was my first time sampling licorice fern!  It was just what I needed today:
rooting around in moss and getting rewarded with that super-concentrated licorice
flavor and sweetness!

[Douglas Deur's book](https://www.worldcat.org/title/862400130) helpfully says that
"[l]icorice fern grows slowly, so leave most of the plant and root system intact."
Today, I just took a few segments of root from a single dead tree.  My plan is to
gather this one infrequently, and not to harvest too much from any one area.
