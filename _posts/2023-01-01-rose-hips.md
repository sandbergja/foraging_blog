Happy new year!  Today, my partner and I went for a muddy
but nice walk, gathering rose hips along the way.  Many of
the rose hips were soft, and I was able to sample the flavor.
The larger rose hips tasted pretty nice raw; the smaller ones were pretty questionable, but I bet they will be nice once cooked and mixed with the others!  I'm hoping to make
[nypponsoppa](https://www.swedishfood.com/swedish-food-recipes-desserts/217-rosehip-soup)
(a really cozy treat) tomorrow.
