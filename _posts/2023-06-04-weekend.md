From the garden, I harvested enough gooseberries to make some nice mini tarts.  I grew up with
gooseberry bushes and my mom's delicious gooseberry pie, so it brought back fond memories.  My partner harvested some of our strawberries
as well.  I was also very happy to notice some new growth on the prickly pear cactus that I rooted back in April.

On the foraging side, my partner and I were after some elderflowers, but we were too late!  The berries were already beginning to form.
No worries: we instead gathered some rose petals, douglas fir tips, and plums.  We also observed some immature hazelnuts and some
osoberries that are getting ever closer to ripeness.  Instagram keeps showing me chocolate-covered confier tips, so I had to try making
some of my own as a cute little dessert.
