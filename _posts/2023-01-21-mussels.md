I had a great time on the Oregon coast yesterday!  Sunny weather and a negative tide --
what a perfect combination!  While it was light out, I went for a bike ride, enjoyed the
beach, and gathered some sea water to boil down for salt.

Low tide was just after sunset, so I got some mussels off the rocks.  The rocks were
covered in sea stars: orange ones and purple ones!  A very fun experience.
