I made a nice vegetarian chili today from ingredients bought at the store and foraged in Central Oregon.

The ingredients I bought:

* Beans
* Epazote
* Knorr's beef powder
* Onion
* Tomatoes
* Chilaca peppers

The ingredients I foraged:

* Juniper berries (I wasn't sure about these, but they were a very nice addition)
* Fireweed buds
* Russian sage (found near the grocery store hahaha)

I had it along with some iced tea (made from white fir tips, waxy currants, Russian sage, and fireweed leaves).
