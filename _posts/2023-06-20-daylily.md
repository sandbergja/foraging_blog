I got a daylily plant last winter.  It bloomed for the first time this week!  I've been able to enjoy seeing the pretty flowers, and then also got to try eating the petals.
They taste so good!  Very sweet and crunchy!

Unfortunately, there are a lot of bugs that like living in the flowers.  It's not a big deal to just rub them off when I snack on the petals, but I think I'd have to do
some pretty vigorous cleaning/scrubbing if I wanted them bug-free enough to put in a salad.
